# petri_hilbert_calculus

Implementation of the ComposePHC method used for the Petri net calculus with Hilbert Composition (PHC)

The implementation is provided in a Jupyter notebook, in the form of a Python code. 
The code strictly follows the pseudo-code of the method, which is a derivation
of the Buchberger algorithm.
